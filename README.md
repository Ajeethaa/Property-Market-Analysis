## Introduction

> This project explores the property market in Perth, Western Australia to help a potential investor in Switzerland who wishes to purchase a property in Perth. Perth is the capital city, also known as the most isolated city in the world according to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-04/most-isolated-city-lures-nasa-talent-in-hunt-for-resources-tech). It is Australiaâ€™s fourth most populous city with an estimated population standing at about [2 085 973](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/B7616AB91C66CDCFCA25827800183B7B?Opendocument) and will continue to grow. The property prices in Perth have been volatile in the past 5 years. However, the demand for units and houses has always stayed steady. 

> With this idea in mind, an investor approached for a review of property prices and housing developments in Perth. The investor plans to migrate to Perth and is on the lookout for a property in which she could live, although she does not have a fixed envision of a property type or budget. She has never invested in Western Australia and would like a report that would highlight the critical details on housing market there as well on the current and future developments within Perth, before she meets a decision.

The analysis will propose the price range based on property type and location within the city. A recommendation is made to this investor on the choice of properties.
